About Me
------

Hello, I am Rohith. I am doing my PhD at the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg advised by Prof. Heike Wehrheim. My research focuses on the explainability of counter-contractual software behaviour i.e. explaining software bugs and failures to developers and end-users. I am also a research fellow at [RTG CAUSE](https://rtg-cause.github.io/).
